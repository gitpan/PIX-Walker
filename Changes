Revision history for PIX-Walker

1.10	November 12, 2008
	Fixed the matching logic in PIX::Accesslist::Line->match.

	Updated POD for all modules.

	Added support for icmp-type object groups.

	Fixed a couple of minor bugs as reported by other users.

	Updated PIX::Accesslist::Line->print to allow for an $any
	string to be specified to change '0.0.0.0/0' entries in the
	output to a string of your choosing.

1.03	June 13, 2006
	Added some methods to PIX::Accesslist::Line for fetching
	the logical elements of a line as strings (protocol, source, 
	dest, etc..)

	Normalized the PIX::Walker standard set of port aliases.

	Added PIX::Object::icmp_type -- Doesn't actually do anything
	though. It's a useless object type to me at the moment. This
	is included so configs with object-groups of icmp-type will 
	be processed correctly.

1.02    June 07, 2006
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
